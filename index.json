The main focus is on developing a so-called “person-specific” (idiographic) research paradigm in which modeling and quantification of intra-individual variability (parameters of a complex dynamical system) is more useful than modeling inter-individual variability (estimating parameters of a static population, or true value).\nFrom this perspective the current ‘Replicability Crisis’ in the social sciences could be a problem of operating within the wrong theoretical paradigm, rather than the wrong application of research methods and inferential statistics.\n\n\nMaarten Wijnants \nMy research focuses on fractal scaling as it relates to motor coordination and literacy.

He received his PhD in Social Sciences (Cum Laude) at the Radboud University Nijmegen in 2007. He is also adjunct professor at the Center for Research in Human Movement Variability of the University of Nebraska at Omaha (USA) and visiting professor at the Graduate School of Psychology of the Universidad de Talca (Chile).\nHis research addresses the coordinative basis of behavior, cognition and their development. This entails a micro-genetic and complex dynamical systems approach to intra- and interpersonal coordination, as well as the advancement of nonlinear time-series techniques to study this. He has published on motor performance, planning, language development, dyslexia, mother-child, client-therapist and peer interaction, and gesture-speech attunement. \n\nAnna Lichtwarck-Aschoff \nI am born in the southern part of Germany and moved all the way up to the northern part of the Netherlands to study psychology in Groningen. I received my PhD from the University of Groningen at the department of Developmental Psychology in 2008. Currently, I am working as an assistant professor in the research program Developmental Psychopathology. Generally, I am not so interested in whether certain interventions work but how they work. That is, I am mainly focusing on general processes and mechanisms of change informed by non-linear dynamic systems theories across diagnostic categories and different treatment modalities. Eventually I hope that by understanding individual processes of change we will be able to personalize and tailor treatments to the specific and changing needs of individual clients. \n\nMerlijn Olthof   \nThe title of my PhD-project is: “Changing Landscapes: a complex systems approach to psychopathology and intervention”. We use principles from Synergetics, a theory of self-organization in complex systems, to formulate hypotheses about how change in psychopathology occurs. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that abrupt changes in psychopathology (order transitions) are preceded by a period of destabilization, characterized by a temporal increase in disorder called critical fluctuations, and an increased sensitivity to external influences. Early-warning signals indicative for destabilization can be useful for clinical practice, as they signal sensitive periods in which treatment efforts might be more effective.\n\n\nLisette de Jonge-Hoekstra     \nResearcher/teacher Psychology @univgroningen.\nEditor @mw_groningen, starting podcaster.\nInto levels, time scales and perspectives (#mom) of/on child development.\n \nGerrieke Druijf-van de Woestijne \nData Scientist at Neurocast\nTeacher at Radboud University Nijmegen\n\n\nComplex Systems Group at the Behavioural Science Institute https://www.ru.nl/bsi/research/group-pages/complex-systems-group/\nComplexity People at BSI Anna Bosman\nFred Hasselman\nMaarten Wijnants\nAnna Lichtwarck-Aschoff\nMarieke van Rooij\nMathijs Vervloed\nRoy Vink\nMerlijn Olthof\nAbele Michela\nWouter Oomens\nRik Kuurstra\nPia Andresen\nGerrieke van de Woestijne\nJames Twose\nFreek Oude Maatman\nAnouk van Hoogdalem\nSander Crielaard\nTon Verhoeven\nWillem Frankenhuis\nBarbara Müller\nNastasia Griffioen\nIsabela Granic\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"aa8d2ba0dda088cdc2b6e59a3f3b3b41","permalink":"https://complexity-methods.github.io/people/persons/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/persons/","section":"people","summary":"Location of lectures \u0026amp;
